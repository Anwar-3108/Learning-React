Q.1 > What is pollyfils ?

A.1> Polifils is a code which is a replacement of a newr version of code. for example some version of browser doesn't understand that what are promises , so polifils converts the pomises code to other code that the perticular browser understand....let's take another Xample and understand what actually pollyfils are , if my browser doesn't support Array.map() so in the pollyfills we can create another map() i.e   myMap(),   which behaves like an actual map() function.

so now the question is what converts our newer code to older code?  so here bables comes into the picture. bables converts our newer code to older code that browser understands. babble use the BrowserList which keeps a track of browser version.
