Q.1 > What is Emmet in coding?

A.1 >Emmet is a free add-on for your text editor. It allows you to type shortcuts that are then expanded into full pieces of code. By using Emmet, developers type less, they save both on keystrokes and time. Also relying on Emmet's auto completion means fewer typos and missing tags, leading to more robust and valid files.

Q.5 > What is the difference between async and difer ?
A.5 > Async allows your script to run as soon as it's loaded, without blocking other elements on the page. Defer means your script will only execute after the page has finished loading. In most cases, async is the better option

---------------Async And  Defer---------------




 Q.6 > What is async in script tag in JavaScript?


A.6 > Async in script tag in JavaScript is a way to load scripts asynchronously. That means, if a script is async, it will be loaded independently of other scripts on the page, and will not block the page from loading.

If you have a page with several external scripts, loading them all asynchronously can speed up the page load time, because the browser can download and execute them in parallel.

To use async, simply add the async attribute to your script tag:

<!-- <script async src="script.js"></script> -->




Q.7 > What is defer in script tag in JavaScript?

A.7 > By using the defer attribute in HTML, the browser will load the script only after parsing (loading) the page. This can be helpful if you have a script that is dependent on other scripts, or if you want to improve the loading time of your page by loading scripts after the initial page load.

To use defer, simply add the defer attribute to your script tag:

<!-- <script defer src="script.js"></script> -->
